## 📝 About This Nano-Degree

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers you a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.
In this program, you’ll master fundamentals that will enable you to go further in the field, launch or advance
a career, and join the next generation of deep learning talent that will help define a beneficial, new,
AI-powered future for our world. You will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional
Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment,
and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy. You’ll learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-Yan
Zhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and Andrew
Trask. For anyone interested in this transformational technology, this program is an ideal point-of-entry.
The program is comprised of 5 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to
prove your skills and demonstrate what you’ve learned in your lessons.

## 📝 About This Project
### ✔ Generate TV Scripts

In this project, you will build your own Recurrent Networks and
Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch. You’ll perform
sentiment analysis and generate new text, and use recurrent
networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV
scripts.
